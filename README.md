# Ecosystem Simulation
  
So this is a "small" project I am working on using C# and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) ([RaylibCS Binding](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs)). I am also using a noise library called [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite). It is inspired by [This Video By Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_It_X7v-1E) and [Nature of Code By Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFlwukCmDf0-1-uSR7mklK).  
I intend to explore and experiment around procedural world generation, and some level of machine learning (Maybe).

## Building the project yourself
For this project you will need
- [.NET 6.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

### Step 1
Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CadenZ-Assignments/Ecosystem-Simulation.git`
### Step 2
Open a console at the cloned directory or just do `cd Ecosystem-Simulation`
### Step 3
Run `dotnet build`  
If you have the correct dotnet version installed, that should be all that you have to do. After it finishes the build, an executable file will be generated in `bin/Debug`
### Step 4
Copy the `resources` folder into the folder where the compiled executable is located *should be in `bin/Debug`* 

## Contributing to the project
Honestly this is just an interest project of my own, but if you really want to help, or point out any mistakes in my code, feel free to open a pull request.
